# Hybrid-Images

The objective of this project is to develop a simple image convolution function and utilize it for generating hybrid images based on a simplified version of the SIGGRAPH 2006 paper authored by Oliva, Torralba, and Schyns. The main concept is that high-frequency elements have a stronger influence on perception when they are discernible, whereas only the low-frequency (smooth) components can be observed at a distance. By merging the high-frequency part of one image with the low-frequency part of another, we can create a hybrid image that elicits different interpretations depending on the viewing distance.

# Installation and working
> Clone this repo <br>
> pip install numpy <br>
> pip install cv2 <br>
> pip install matplotlib <br>
> pip install math
> Replace the paths for the images to make an hybrid for in main.py file.


Run main.py . Hybrid images will be generated.
